Rust's approach encourages composition over inheritance and favours traits for code reuse and polymorphism.

Rust uses structs instead of classes to define data structures and associated behaviours.

Traits in Rust allow you to define common behaviours that an animal can implement, such as Feedable or PerformTrick, and then have individual animal instances implement those traits as needed. This approach provides a more modular and flexible way to represent the diverse characteristics and behaviours of animals in a zoo simulation.
